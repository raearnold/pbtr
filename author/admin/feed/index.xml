				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Time to destroy: 5 minutes</strong></p>
<p>Though we didn’t expect this toy to last long, we couldn’t resist capturing a bit of the Angry Birds craze. At first, our tester was content to run around with the toy in his mouth, but after a few minutes, the time to destroy came.</p>
<p>Once he started chewing, the toy only lasted around 30 seconds before we removed it from his jaws. The latex and foam stood no chance against a determined to chew dog—it was punctured on the first chomp.</p>

<p><strong>Time to destroy: still in one piece</strong></p>
<p>The Unbreakoball was created for one purpose: to provide a long-lasting toy that bully breeds love to play with. So, it’s no wonder that ours is still in great shape after eight months. It also comes with a guarantee for replacement if it breaks within 90 days of receipt, in case your dog has titanium jaws.</p>
<p>That said, it doesn’t rank high on our tester’s list of favorite toys—most likely because he can’t destroy it! It does see play time, and it is one we have no reservations about leaving out for free access. But, since it can’t by destroyed and fetch doesn’t hold his attention for long, this isn’t the most popular toy in the house.</p>
<p>Don’t let that deter you, however, especially if your dog loves to fetch and play with balls. This toy is a great value for your money—you should be able to find it for under $20 including shipping. And as Pit Bull owners know, if the toy stays in one piece for longer than a week, that $20 is well spent.</p>
<h2>Where to buy</h2>
<p>You can buy the Unbreakoball on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004KA85SA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=racharnoonli-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004KA85SA">Amazon</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=racharnoonli-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B004KA85SA" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" />, but we encourage you to purchase it straight from the source: <a href="http://www.unbreakoball.com/" rel="external affiliate">Unbreakoball.com</a>, to keep these great supporters of Pit Bulls and other bully breeds profiting.</p>
<p>The Unbreakoball is also available in a 10″ “Big Daddy” size.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dogs love to chew on bones, but <strong>keep cooked bones away from your pit bull</strong> or bully-breed dog—especially small bones like chicken bones.</p>
<p>Once cooked, bones become brittle and can splinter, causing issues with your dog’s digestive track, possibly causing internal bleeding. Small bones can also be choking hazards.</p>
<p>Instead of cooked bones, you can buy raw bones such as beef knuckles that can withstand your dog’s strong jaws without splintering. However, make sure to monitor your dog in case they show any resource guarding—you should be able to ask your dog to drop the bone and have them comply. If they get defensive over a real animal bone, stick with nylon or other types of chew toys while you work on their possessive tendencies.</p>

<p><strong>Time to destroy: 5 minutes*</strong></p>
<p>Like all stuffed toys that meet a pit bull’s jaws, Lamb Chop’s song ended quickly. Our tester went straight to tearing out the squeak bladders—starting with the one in the head.</p>
<p>Because of the swiftness with which he went for the bladders, we removed the toy from his reach after he chewed through the face fabric . To date, the toy isn’t fully destroyed, however it’s a safety hazard for him to continue “playing” with it, so we count it as destroyed and keep it out of reach.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Time to destroy: 10 minutes*</strong></p>
<p>These small fabric toys are stuffing-free, have two squeakers (head and tail) and some type of crackling material in the four paws. Our tester tears the squeak bladders out of the head and tail within ten minutes of being given the toy.</p>
<p>However, don’t count it as a total loss—our dog is perfectly content to carry the fabric carcass around and lightly chew on it for hours as a comfort toy. He also runs around with the toy hanging out of his mouth and occasionally throws it so that he can retrieve it. You could do worse for <strong>$3.99</strong>.</p>
<p>If you do buy this, make sure to supervise and recover the squeak bladders before your dog is able to swallow them. Throw it out once it becomes too ratty, or before your dog pulls it apart to the point that it becomes a choking hazard.</p>
<h2>Where to buy</h2>
<p><strong>This Boots &amp; Barkley® toy can be purchased in Target stores.</strong> It’s not available in their online store.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If there is one mainstream category of dog toy that you should never give your pit bull, it is <strong>rawhide</strong>. While perfect toys for many other breeds, these pose major health hazards to your pitty including <strong>choking, blocked intestines, and intestinal tearing</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Why shouldn’t you give your pit bull-type dog rawhide?</em> Rawhide has a tendency to shatter into slivers when dry. Your dog has extremely strong jaws that will chomp through a rawhide bone well before another breed’s would. When another breed has a rawhide bone, they will sit and gnaw, thoroughly soaking the rawhide into a mushy substance that will not splinter once swallowed.</p>
<p><strong>Your pit bull will have shattered and swallowed the rawhide well before it mushes into a safe consistency.</strong> Once the swallowed rawhide hits your dog’s digestive track, it may splinter, leaving small slivers that can embed themselves in your dog’s intestines, causing internal bleeding and other complications.</p>
<p>Additionally, rawhide is not easily digested, meaning the large chunks your dog manages to swallow (if they don’t choke on it first!) can block their intestines, causing vomiting and other issues.</p>
<p>Some experts claim that the compressed rawhide chews are safe—they have been processed so that they don’t splinter in the same way. But, to be safe you are best off choosing another type of chew for your pit bull. And make sure to never give your pit bull or bully breed a rolled rawhide bone, regardless of the size of the bone.</p>

<p><strong>Wolf Size</strong></p>
<p><strong>Time to destroy: &lt; 60 seconds</strong></p>
<p>While these are intended to be edible, we hoped they would last more than thirty seconds apiece. The bone split into pieces in one chomp, making it easy work for our tester to chew up and swallow the entire bone in under a minute.</p>
<p>This treat is not a good choice if you are looking for something edible to distract or entertain your pit bull for any length of time. Find something more substantial, or at least try the larger size.</p>
<h2>Buy this instead:</h2>
<p>The wolf size is too small for pit bulls, even if they are within the recommended weight range.
