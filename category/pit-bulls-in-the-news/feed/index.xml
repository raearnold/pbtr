				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the mass of news articles that (often erroneously) blame bully breeds for any number of attacks and brutal actions are media reports on pit bulls at their best: performing loving, loyal, and courageous acts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Boston pit bull, Lilly,<a title="View the story at globalanimal.org" href="http://www.globalanimal.org/2012/05/10/brave-pit-bull-saves-woman-from-train-video/73865/" rel="external"> saved her owner</a> from an oncoming train.</li>
<li>A family pit bull in Georgia <a title="View the story at the Huffington Post" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/25/pit-bull-saves-woman-brain-aneurysm-_n_1030966.html" rel="external">alerted one owner that his wife had fallen</a>. Had the dog not let him know something was wrong, there would have been no time to save her.</li>
<li>A stray pit bull in Port Charlotte, FL<a title="View the story on the Inquisitr" href="http://www.inquisitr.com/205846/stray-pit-pull-saves-mother-and-child-from-knife-wielding-attacker/" rel="external"> saved a woman and her young son from a knife-wielding attacker</a>.</li>
<li>A stray pit bull puppy in Ontario <a title="Read the story" href="http://bullmarketfrogs.com/blog/2011/07/mystery-pit-bull-saves-brantford-woman-spca-says-too-bad/" rel="external">protected a woman from cars as she had a stroke while walking on the side of the road</a>, and alerted her husband of the issue. Because of Ontario laws, the dog almost lost its life purely for being a bully breed, but thankfully they were able to send “Faith” to a caring home in B.C.</li>
</ul>
<p>What is your favorite feel-good bully breed story in the news?</p>
